University Inventory Stock System in Java Swing

In this project I programmed a stock system for my university. 
There are ids, names, stock situations, and photos of inventories for each faculty.
First, when user want to log in the university database, he have to enter his 
user name and password, if he is a personel, he only can see the stock situtation of faculties,
but if he is a manager, he can also change the amount of items.
